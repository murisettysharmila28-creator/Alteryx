# Alteryx Projects

Data wrangling, exploratory analysis, and machine learning workflows built using **Alteryx Designer**.

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of Alteryx workflows developed for academic learning and portfolio demonstration.  
The projects focus on data preparation, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and predictive modeling using a no-code / low-code analytics approach.

## Repository Structure

- **Data_Wrangling/**
  - Core data cleaning, aggregation, and transformation workflows

- **Real-Estate_Data_Prep/**
  - Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
  - Feature engineering
  - Data validation and encoding for machine learning

- **Linear_Regression_Real_estate/**
  - End-to-end Linear Regression modeling workflow
  - Train-test split, scoring, and error evaluation

Each folder contains its own README with detailed workflow explanations and outputs.
